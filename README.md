# Graph Visualization and Traversal

## 📌 About The Project
This project visualizes a weighted undirected graph using the NetworkX library in Python. It demonstrates Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal.

## 🚀 Features
👉 Graph representation with nodes and weighted edges  
👉 Visualization using Matplotlib and NetworkX  
👉 Dijkstra's shortest path calculation  
👉 DFS and BFS traversal  
👉 Edge labeling with weights  

## ⚡ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/graph-visualization.git
   cd graph-visualization
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install networkx matplotlib
   ```

### Usage
Run the script using:
```sh
python main.py
```

### Output
- A graphical representation of the graph
- Console output displaying:
  - Dijkstra's shortest paths and their lengths
  - DFS and BFS traversal sequences

## 📝 Code Overview
- Defines a set of vertices (nodes) and weighted edges
- Uses NetworkX to create and visualize the graph
- Computes and prints shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Implements DFS and BFS for graph traversal
- Displays the graph with edge weights labeled
